# 🐜 Swarm Sim: An Interactive Ant Colony Simulation

An educational simulation game developed in Unity to visually demonstrate the principles of **Swarm Intelligence**, with a focus on **Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)**. This project gamifies ACO algorithms to help students and educators understand emergent behavior, pheromone communication, and decentralized decision-making through an interactive, hands-on experience.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to teach abstract AI concepts using simulation-based learning. The ant simulation models:

- **Pheromone trail-laying and decay**
- **Adaptive pathfinding**
- **Obstacle avoidance**
- **Parameter tuning for experimentation**
- **Gamified feedback via a custom dialogue system**

The goal: make swarm intelligence accessible, engaging, and intuitive for AI learners.

## 🛠️ Features

- Built with **Unity** using **C#**
- Real-time **pheromone simulation and visualization**
- **Dynamic ant behaviors**: foraging, trail-following, obstacle navigation
- **User interface** for adjusting core parameters (e.g., decay rate, ant speed)
- **Educational textbox system** introducing swarm intelligence step-by-step
- **Custom-designed 2D assets** (Aseprite)
- Supports future integration with **LLMs for interactive learning**

## 🧠 AI Concepts Demonstrated

- **Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)**
- **Emergent behavior**
- **Stigmergy and pheromone-based coordination**
- **Local rule-based decision making**
